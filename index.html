        <p>We created the group six months ago with a mission of supporting Filipino-Australians ICT professionals and those who aspire to enter the tech workforce in Canberra through enablement and networking activities.</p>
        <p>Community building isn’t easy, especially when you are operating without funding and are relying on volunteer time. But hearing the feedback like the above makes us think our efforts are worth it, knowing that we can have a positive impact on others and even inspire them to think of ways on how to help others as well. Regardless of your age, status, gender, or background, you can find a way to pay it forward and help people in our community.</p>
        <p>You can break the mold and take that first step to reach those sectors of our community that need a leg-up.</p>
        <p>Come join us and be part of our mission!</p>
